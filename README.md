# JS-Patterns
Hello! Let me quickly introduce you into the project. First of all, this is demonstration of applying different patterns on the shop administration OOP example.
Used patterns:
- Creational: Singleton
- Structural: ?
- Behavioral: ?

# Content
We have a single file here.
- shopAdministration_old.js
- shopAdministration_new.js

# Navigation
How to navigate through files?
Files with '_ old' mean that they were at the beginning of the project.
Files with '_ new' mean final solutions.
Example of code '_old' JS code was taken from my previous repository 'JS-SOLID'.
Final solution was implemented by me.
