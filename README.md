Used patterns:
- Creational: Singleton
- Structural: Facade
- Behavioral: Observer

# Content

# Navigation
How to navigate through files?<br />
Files with '_ old' mean that they were at the beginning of the project.<br />
Files with '_ new' mean final solutions.<br />
Example of code from '_old' JS code was taken from my previous repository 'JS-SOLID'.<br />
Final solution was implemented by me.<br />
